# Identify Customer Segments

Project code for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program. In this project, our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. You’ll look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.
